# Shark Game

Shark Game is a web game made entirely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript by Cirrial. It is a game belonging to the "idle" or "incremental" genre. It does not require constant player attention, and can progress while the player does other things before returning to it. This isn't in any way a new or pioneering concept - a lot of people have probably heard of Candy Box or A Dark Room, or the more popular contemporary Cookie Clicker.

## Development Plan

Cirrial originally developed this game in about 2014 for a gamejam, but continued to develop it afterward. It quickly became a niche favorite among idle game enthusiasts. After a string of updates, Cirrial dropped development in mid-2015. The final version is v0.71.

While the game is in a more-than-playable state, it remains unfinished. This mod, dubbed New Frontiers, intends to finish what Cirrial started, and then move on to reimagine the game and its world.

Development will come in two phases: first, filling in the gaps in the original game and rebalancing it. This will entail rebalancing each of the worldtypes, filling in a number of  missing sprites, and rebalancing the recycler and shark machines.

In the second phase, the game will be reimagined with completely new ideas. Each of the 7 original worldtypes will have major changes to clean up their resource networks, making progression simpler and every creature and job more meaningful. New basic animals will be added, and there will be very little overlap between worlds in terms of those animals, making each place visited unique from the last. All of the non-shark machines will receive reworks during this time. Finally, there are a number of secret plans for a larger and more robust game progression.

The Projects tab has a project which details the development of the first version.
